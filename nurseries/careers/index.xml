      <description>We are looking for full-time Early Years Educators / Nursery Practitioners to join our friendly, enthusiastic and hard-working family at the Landbeach Nursery, just outside Cambridge.
What youâ€™ll do:  Greet children each day with a warm, kind smile that makes them feel loved and welcomed. Be always ready to build a fully functional space rocket from a kitchen roll tube, 2 elastic bands, and a handful of pipe cleaners. Share songs, stories, and creative activities that everyone will enjoy (being in tune is optional, but knowing Frozen lyrics is a plus!</description>
